Consulting Startup GRC Framework

This project builds a security and compliance framework for a small IT consulting startup with limited staff and limited budget. The goal is to help the company understand risks, protect client data, and create a simple governance structure. The project includes a risk register in Excel and a Power BI dashboard that tracks risk levels, control status, and compliance. The framework aligns with NIST CSF and CIS Controls.
