# Control Mapping Overview

This folder contains the organization’s control mappings to two major cybersecurity frameworks:

- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**
- **CIS Critical Security Controls (v8)**

The purpose of this mapping is to help a small business align its security program with widely-recognized industry standards, demonstrate compliance to auditors, and identify security gaps that require improvement.

## 📘 What This Mapping Includes

### 1. NIST CSF Controls
Each NIST CSF requirement is mapped with the following fields:

- **Control ID** – Example: PR.AC-1, DE.CM-1  
- **Requirement** – The specific control definition  
- **Status** – Not Started, In Progress, Complete  
- **Owner** – Responsible party (IT Admin, Security Lead, CTO)  
- **Evidence** – Artifacts proving the control is implemented  
- **Notes** – Additional context or planned actions  

---

### 2. CIS Controls (v8)
Each CIS safeguard is mapped to:

- **Safeguard ID** – Example: 1.1, 4.3, 9.2  
- **CIS Control** – Parent control category  
- **Requirement** – Safeguard description  
- **Status** – Implementation tracking  
- **Owner** – Responsible team/role  
- **Evidence** – Documentation or proof  
- **Notes** – Risk considerations or upgrades  

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Mapping

This mapping provides:

- A **single source of truth** for all security controls  
- A baseline for **internal audits**  
- A structured method for **tracking compliance progress**  
- Clarity on **who owns each control**  
- Easy integration with the **Compliance Checklist** spreadsheet

## 📁 Files in This Folder

1. **NIST-Control-Mapping.xlsx**  
   Contains all mapped NIST CSF controls.

2. **CIS-Control-Mapping.xlsx**  
   Contains all mapped CIS safeguards.

3. **README.md**  
   This file, explaining the structure of the control mapping system.

## ✔ How This Supports Your GRC Framework

These mappings directly support:

- **Risk Register**  
- **Compliance Checklist**  
- **Security Policies**  
- **Power BI Dashboards**  
- **Audit Readiness**  

They help demonstrate that your company’s controls, policies, and procedures tie back to trusted security frameworks.

## 📌 Next Steps

After control mapping is set up, continue with:

- Updating evidence as policies and procedures are created  
- Using this mapping to support compliance dashboards  
- Using mappings during security reviews or audits
